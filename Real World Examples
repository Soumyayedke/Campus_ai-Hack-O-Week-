Real-World Use

This Student Query Intent Classifier can be used in real educational systems to automate and improve student support services.

1. College Chatbots

The classifier can be integrated into a chatbot to automatically detect whether a student query is related to:

Admissions

Exams

Timetable

Hostel

Scholarships

Fees

The chatbot can then provide the correct response instantly.

2. Helpdesk Automation

Instead of manually reading every query, the system can:

Categorize incoming emails

Route tickets to the correct department

Reduce administrative workload

 3. Email/Ticket Routing System

When a student sends an email like:

"When will exam results be declared?"

The system automatically assigns it to the Examination Department.

 4. Mobile App Integration

It can be integrated into:

College mobile apps

ERP systems

Student portals

This improves response time and user experience.

 5. Foundation for AI Chatbot

This project can serve as the base model for:

Smart campus chatbot

AI-based student assistant

Automated query resolution system

 Impact
